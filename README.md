# Liver-Cirrhosis-Stage-Detection
A machine learning project that predicts liver cirrhosis stage (1‚Äì3) based on biochemical and clinical test data from the Mayo Clinic PBC study using Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM models.
# ü©∫ Liver Cirrhosis Stage Detection using Machine Learning

This project predicts the **stage of liver cirrhosis** in patients based on clinical and biochemical test data. Using machine learning algorithms, the system classifies patients into different stages of liver damage, helping assess disease progression and assist medical decision-making.

## üéØ Objective
To build a machine learning model capable of predicting the **level of liver damage (cirrhosis stage)** based on patient data from the Mayo Clinic‚Äôs study on primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) conducted between **1974 and 1984**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Workflow

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preprocessing
- Loaded and inspected the dataset for missing values and data types  
- Converted categorical variables (Drug, Sex, Ascites, etc.) into numeric values  
- Dropped irrelevant columns (`N_Days`, `Status`, `Stage`) for training features  
- Standardized numerical features using **StandardScaler**

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualized **stage distribution** using Seaborn count plots  
- Displayed **feature histograms** for numerical variables  
- Generated **correlation heatmaps** for major clinical indicators  

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Model Training and Evaluation
Trained multiple supervised learning models:

| Model | Description | Accuracy (%) |
|--------|--------------|--------------|
| Logistic Regression | Multinomial logistic model | ~78% |
| Random Forest (Baseline) | Ensemble classifier with 100 trees | ~85% |
| Random Forest (Tuned) | GridSearchCV optimized hyperparameters | **~88%** |
| SVM (RBF Kernel) | Non-linear classifier for complex decision boundaries | ~80% |

Each model was evaluated using:
- **Accuracy score**  
- **Confusion matrix visualization**  
- **Classification report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)**  

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Feature Importance
Used Random Forest to identify key biochemical indicators affecting liver cirrhosis stage:
- Bilirubin, Albumin, SGOT, Prothrombin, and Copper were among the most important features.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ ROC Curve Analysis
Generated **One-vs-Rest ROC curves** for each class to evaluate the discriminative power of the tuned Random Forest model.
